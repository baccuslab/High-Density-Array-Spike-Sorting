function  yi = upsampleInterp(y, xi, h, p)
% This is a modified version of the standard resample function of matlab.
% Instead of filtering the whole data (here called y) it returns the
% interpolated values only at the points specified in xi. This saves a lot 
% of time and memory if only, e.g. the location of the maximum of a
% timeseries is searched
% the resample filter needs to be provided in B. Use resampleDesignFilter
% to compute it

% include zeros into y
y = [y;
     zeros(p-1, size(y,2))];
y = y(:);
 
% Need to delay output so that downsampling by q hits center tap of filter.
nz = floor(q-mod(Lhalf,q));
z = zeros(1,nz);
h = [z h(:).'];  % ensure that h is a row vector.
Lhalf = Lhalf + nz;

% Number of samples removed from beginning of output sequence 
% to compensate for delay of linear phase filter:
delay = floor(ceil(Lhalf)/q);

% Need to zero-pad so output length is exactly ceil(Lx*p/q).
nz1 = 0;
while ceil( ((Lx-1)*p+length(h)+nz1 )/q ) - delay < ceil(Lx*p/q)
    nz1 = nz1+1;
end
h = [h zeros(1,nz1)];

% ----  HERE'S THE CALL TO UPFIRDN  ----------------------------
y = upfirdn(x,h,p,q);

% Get rid of trailing and leading data so input and output signals line up
% temporally:
Ly = ceil(Lx*p/q);  % output length
% Ly = floor((Lx-1)*p/q+1);  <-- alternately, to prevent "running-off" the
%                                data (extrapolation)
if isvect
    y(1:delay) = [];
    y(Ly+1:end) = [];
else
    y(1:delay,:) = [];
    y(Ly+1:end,:) = [];
end

h([1:nz (end-nz1+1):end]) = [];  % get rid of leading and trailing zeros 
                                 % in case filter is output
